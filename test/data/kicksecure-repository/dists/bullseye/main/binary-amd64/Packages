Description: anonymity, privacy and security settings pre-configuration
 Most settings take effect for newly created user account onlys, and not
 for existing user accounts.
 .
 Sets timezone to UTC.
 .
 Enables Menubar in Dolphin by default.
 .
 gnupg configuration for Anonymity Distributions:
  * Sets `use-tor` in `/etc/skel/.gnupg/dirmngr.conf`.
  * Ships Thunderbird torbirdy configuration file
 `/etc/thunderbird/pref/30_whonix.js` that allows torified keyserver access.
  * Deactivates KGpg's first run wizard. Disables tip of the day.
  Disables KGpg's systray. Disables key server. Reference:
  "High-risk users should stop using the keyserver network immediately."
 .
 Double click instead of single click in KDE.
 .
 Deactivates maximize windows when moved to the top.
 In context of anonymity it might be better not to maximize the browser window
 (https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7255).
 To prevent users from accidentally maximizing their browser window, it is
 better when KDE's feature to maximize windows when moved to the top is
 disabled.
 .
 Deactivates KDE's system sounds.
 .
 Disables KDE graphics effects. Disables some background processes.
 .
 Stream Isolation (proxy) settings for KDE apps for Anonymity Distributions
 Configures global proxy settings, which acts as a fallback if no other proxy
 settings are set, for KDE applications to socks 10.152.152.10:9122.
 IP HARDCODED above but no need to change since it is description only.
 Otherwise unconfigured KDE applications would use no proxy settings
 (Transparent Proxying) if the anonymity distribution features a transparent
 proxy.
 Useful to improve stream isolation.
 On the other hand, anonymity distributions not featuring transparent proxying
 should probably not install this package by default, because then unconfigured
 KDE applications should by default not be able to connect.
 .
 Sets Unlimited Scrollback in Konsole.
 .
 Disables klipper clipboard history.
 .
 Deactivates automatic updates for Package Manager APT and Apper
 Useful in context of networks with limited traffic quota, slow networks and
 anonymity distributions.
 In latter case, the default automatic updates interval would be too
 predictable (expectable amount of traffic every X), thus eventually be
 vulnerable for traffic fingerprinting.
 Disabling Apper automatic updates only takes effect for newly created user
 accounts. Not for existing user accounts. This is most useful to help Linux
 distribution maintainers setting divergent defaults.
 .
 Longer Timeouts for Package Manager APT
 Raising timeout and retries using configuration snippet. Useful in context of
 slow networks and anonymity distributions.
 .
 Ships a configuration file /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/90longer-timeouts to configure
 apt-get.
 .
 Ships a configuration file /etc/skel/.config/vlc/vlcrc to configure VLC to not
 ask for network policy at start and sets vout=xcb_x11 to enable VM
 compatibility out-of-the-box.
 .
 Disabled gajim update manager by default for better security since it does not
 verify software signatures by hiding file
 /usr/share/gajim/plugins/plugin_installer/__init__.py using
 'config-package-dev' 'hide'.
 .
 Disables systemd-resolved during boot unless file /etc/dns-enable exists.
 .
 Disables systemd-resolved fallback DNS (which by default is set to Google).
 .
 Removes capabilities from `/bin/ping` if
 [security-misc](https://github.com/Whonix/security-misc) is
 installed as ping doesn't work with Tor anyway and its capabilities are just
 unneeded attack surface.
 .
 Create a dummy Tor binary '/home/user/.local/share/Bisq/btc_mainnet/tor/tor'
 to avoid Tor over Tor.
 .
 Improves HexChat Privacy Settings
  * As per:
  https://gitlab.torproject.org/legacy/trac/-/wikis/doc/TorifyHOWTO/XChat
  * Moves the following files:
  - `/usr/lib/xchat/plugins/python.so`
  - `/usr/lib/xchat/plugins/tcl.so`
  - `/usr/lib/xchat/plugins/perl.so`
 to `/usr/share/anon-apps-config`, so these plugins get disabled by
 default.
 .
 Due to technical limitations some settings only take effect for applications
 being started for the very first time, i.e. when the user config of that
 application in the user's home folder does not exist yet. Works best for new
 user accounts.
 .
 This package is most useful to help Linux distribution maintainers setting
 divergent defaults.

Description: APT Sources List for Security-Focussed Linux Distributions
 A question of distribution maintenance strategies. The more standard
 way would indeed be populating /etc/apt/sources.list at install or build time
 and leaving /etc/apt/sources.list.d alone. The idea of managing
 /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list for the user is, the security-focused
 distribution maintainers can decide when it is a better "change stable to
 oldstable", "keep wheezy as long as needed to work out [eventual!] issues
 that would break during upgrade to jessie" and such.

Description: Prevents Tor over Tor in Anonymity Distribution Workstations
 Supposed to be installed on Workstations, which prevents installing the real
 Tor package from upstream (ex: Debian, The Tor Project) APT repositories. Its
 purpose is to prevent, running Tor over Tor.
 .
 It allows installation of packages, which depend on Tor, such as TorChat,
 parcimonie and torbrowser-launcher.
 .
 This package uses the "Provides: tor" field[1], which should avoid any kinds of
 conflicts, in case upstream releases a higher version of Tor. This won't work
 for packages, which depend on an explicit version of Tor (such as TorChat).
 This is non-ideal, since for example the torchat package will install Tor, but
 still acceptable, because of the following additional implementations.
 .
 Binaries eventually installed (by the tor Debian package) /usr/bin/tor as well
 as /usr/sbin/tor are replaced with a dummy wrapper that does nothing
 (dpkg-diverted using config-package-dev).
 .
 systemd-socket-proxyd listens on Tor's default ports. system Tor's
 127.0.0.1:9050, 127.0.0.1:9051 and TBB's 127.0.0.1:9150, 127.0.0.1:9051,
 which prevents the
 default Tor Browser Bundle or Tor package by The Tor Project from opening
 these default ports, which will result in Tor failing to open its listening
 port and therefore exiting, thus preventing Tor over Tor.

Description: Full system AppArmor policy
 This is an AppArmor policy to confine all user space processes on the system which
 allows one to enforce a strong security model and follow principle of least privilege.
 An AppArmor policy for the init, systemd is loaded in the initramfs which then
 applies to all other processes. Specific policies for many system services/applications
 are also enforced.
 .
 This follows design ideas already present in other operating systems such as Android
 and attempts to make something similar available on desktop Linux.
 .
 In addition to locking down user space, this also protects the kernel as it restricts
 access to kernel interfaces like `/proc` or `/sys`, making kernel pointer and other
 leaks much less likely.
 .
 This does not and cannot confine the kernel or initramfs.
 .
 This is expected to be used in combination with other security technologies such as
 a hardened kernel, strong sandboxing architecture, verified boot and so on.
 .
 apparmor-profile-everything supports different boot modes: aadebug and superroot.
 aadebug allows certain permissions necessary for advanced debugging and superroot
 relaxes the policy substantially, even making bypasses possible. It is highly
 recommended to stick to the default boot mode.
 .
 It also contains a wrapper to restrict apt as apt requires permissions that may
 be abused to circumvent the policy. When updating or installing applications, you
 must use the `rapt` command.
 .
 This is still in development and breakage is likely. This should only be used by
 developers for now.
 .
 For now, please only use this development discussion forum thread:

Description: Randomizes clock when systems boots
 Randomizes clock at boot time. Moves clock a few seconds and nanoseconds
 to past or future. Useful in context of anonymity/privacy/Tor.
 .
 This is useful to enforce the design goal, that the host clock and
 Gateway/Workstation clock should always slightly differ (even before secure
 timesync succeeded!) to prevent time based fingerprinting / linkablity
 issues.
 .
 Runs before Tor / sdwdate (if installed).

Description: Tor traffic whitelisting gateway
 There are several transparently torifying gateways. They suffer from the same
 problems:
 .
  - It's tricky to isolate circuits and issue NEWNYM signals, especially if
  multiple client computers are involved.
  - Any garbage software can pump identifiers into "anonymous" circuits, and
  get itself exploited by malicious exit nodes.
  - Trust is centralized to the gateway, which is bad enough when used by one
  person, and just inappropriate when shared with strangers.
 .
 corridor takes a different approach. It allows only connections to Tor relays
 to pass through (no clearnet leaks!), but client computers are themselves
 responsible for torifying their own traffic. In other words, it is a filtering
 gateway, not a proxying gateway.
 .
 You can think of it as defense in depth for your vanilla Tor Browser or Tails,
 for your beautiful scary experimental Qubes proxying schemes, etc. Or invite
 the hood to use your Wi-Fi without getting into trouble.

 damngpl will parse a Debian-style /var/lib/dpkg/status file and extract source
 package information about installed packages. This information can be used in
 several ways, usually to download source packages.
 .
 Multiple input files can be specified on the command line, or piped into
 standard input if no files are specified. Results are returned to standard
 output.
 .
 The name damngpl was chosen as a tongue-in-cheek description of its purpose
 (downloading Debian sources for the Finnix project to remain GPL compliant).
 Please do not send hate mail to the author, thinking he is anti-GPL. He's not.

Description: Enables miscellaneous debug settings
 Ships a `/etc/default/grub.d/45_debug-misc.cfg` configuration file,
 that removes `quiet`, `loglevel=0` and `debugfs=off` from the
 `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` variable and adds `debug=vc` to the kernel
 boot parameter to enable verbose output during the initial ramdisk boot
 phase.
 .
 Undo debugging related `sysctl` settings by package `security-misc`.
 .
 Enables persistent systemd journal log.
 .
 Disables `/lib/systemd/coredump.conf.d/disable-coredumps.conf` by package
 `security-misc` by creating a symlink from
 `/etc/systemd/coredump.conf.d/disable-coredumps.conf` to `/dev/null`.
 `debian/debug-misc.links`
 .
 Disables `panic-on-oops`, `remove-system.map` by package `security-misc`.
 .
 `config-package-dev` `hide` `/etc/sysctl.d/30_silent-kernel-printk.conf` which
 kernel.printk to default as if security-misc would not have lowered verbosity.
 .
 Configure systemd `getty` service to not clear `tty`.
 `/lib/systemd/system/getty@tty.service.d/30_debug-misc.conf`
 .
 Coredumps are enabled.
 `/etc/security/limits.d/40_debug-misc.conf`
 .
 Coredumps may contain important information such as encryption keys or
 passwords. Package `security-misc` disables coredumps. Package `debug-misc`
 re-enables coredumps.
 .
 Contains a helper tool to cause a segfault for testing purposes.
 `segfault-build` creates `segfault-run`. Running `segfault-run` results in
 `segfault-run` terminating with a segfault. This is useful to test if
 coredump files are being generated when an application crashes.
 `/usr/sbin/segfault-build`
 `/usr/share/debug-misc/segfault.c`
 .
 For better usability, to ease debugging in case of issues.
 .
 For better security, this package should only be installed on specific
 machines that require debugging. Unfortunately, security and debugging are
 conflicting optimization goals.

 builds not having user `user` already created.
 .
 Adds user `user` to groups `cdrom`, `audio`, `dip`, `sudo`, `plugdev`.
 .
 Ships a systemd unit file dist-skel-first-boot.service
 which runs `/usr/libexec/helper-scripts/first-boot-skel`
 (part of helper-scripts) package.
 .
 Simplifies sudo default lecture to only showing the default password once.
 .
 Creates version file `/var/lib/dist-base-files/build_version`.
 .

Description: Generic Makefile
 Makes packaging simpler. No more need to manually maintain
 'make install' targets or distribution specific install files such as
 debian/pkg-name.install.
 .
 Files in etc/... in root source folder will be installed to /etc/..., files in
 usr/... will be installed to /usr/... and so forth. This should make renaming,
 moving files around, packaging, etc. very simple. Packaging of most packages
 can look very similar.
 .
 Provides common make targets such as 'make install', 'make dist',
 'make installsim', 'make installcheck', 'make uninstall',
 'make uninstallcheck', 'make distclean'.
 .
 Very extensible through
 file ./make-helper-overrides.bsh or
 folder ./make-helper-overrides.d.
 By using overrides, any make target can be easily extended using pre or post
 hooks or replaced.
 Override files which are executable will be used.
 Override files which are not executable will be skipped.
 .
 Contains a minimal Makefile while the heavy lifting is done by a bash script
 make-helper.bsh.
 .
 Building for multiple platforms possible, example:
 export make_cross_build_platform_list="i386 amd64"
 .
 Can call with lintian (static analysis tool for Debian packages).
 By default it will be using lintian if installed while failing open
 (non-zero exit code).
 lintian can be disabled.
 export make_use_lintian=false
 Or can be configured to fail closed (non-zero exit code).
 export make_use_lintian=true
 .
 Can build packages without chroot using debuild (default) or inside chroot
 using cowbuilder. To enable cowbuilder, use:
 export make_use_cowbuilder=true
 .
 Supports signing packages using debsign.
 (sign a Debian .changes and .dsc file pair using GPG)
 export make_use_debsign=true

Description: Hardened Kernel for Host and VMs
 This is a hardened kernel configuration for Whonix / Kicksecure.
 hardened-vm-kernel is designed specifically for virtual machines and
 hardened-host-kernel is designed for hosts.
 .
 Both configs try to have as many hardening options enabled as possible and
 have little attack surface. hardened-vm-kernel only has support for VMs
 and all other hardware options are disabled to reduce attack surface and
 compile time.
 .
 During installation of hardened-vm-kernel, it compiles the kernel on your own
 machine and does not use a pre-compiled kernel. This ensures the kernel
 symbols in the compiled image are completely unique which makes it far harder
 for kernel exploits. This is possible due to hardened-vm-kernel having only VM
 config options enabled which drastically reduces compile time.
 .
 During installation of hardened-host-kernel, the kernel is not compiled on
 your machine and it uses a pre-compiled kernel. This is because the host
 kernel needs most hardware options enabled to support most devices which makes
 compilation take a very long time.
 .
 The VM kernel is more secure than the host kernel due to having less attack
 surface and not being pre-compiled but if you want more security for the host,
 it is recommended to edit the hardened host config, enable only the hardware
 options you need and compile the kernel yourself. This makes the security of
 the host and VM kernel comparable.
 .
 Both configs were based on the default Debian config.
 .
 These kernels use the linux-hardened patch for further hardening. Custom
 hardening patches should be
 sent there.
 .
 This only supports LTS kernels as they have the least attack surface (stable
 kernels have more code and more bugs) and the best stability.
 .
 Build script /usr/share/hardened-vm-kernel/build does not run automatic yet.
 .
 Kernel does not get installed automatic yet.

Description: security-focused general purpose memory allocator
 This is a security-focused general purpose memory allocator providing the
 malloc API along with various extensions. It provides substantial hardening
 against heap corruption vulnerabilities. The security-focused design also
 leads to much less metadata overhead and memory waste from fragmentation than
 a more traditional allocator design. It aims to provide decent overall
 performance with a focus on long-term performance and memory usage rather than
 allocator micro-benchmarks. It offers scalability via a configurable number of
 entirely independently arenas, with the internal locking within arenas further
 divided up per size class.
 .
 It can be added as a preloaded library using /etc/ld.so.preload.
 .
 Ships two files:
 .
  * [1] /usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so/libhardened_malloc.so
  * [2] /usr/lib/libhardened_malloc.so/libhardened_malloc-light.so
 .
 [1] Was compiled with Hardened Malloc Default compilation parameters.

Description: Whitelisting filter for dangerous Tor control protocol commands
 Filters out Tor control protocol commands that are dangerous for anonymity
 such as GETINFO ADDRESS using a whitelist. Acts as a proxy between the client
 application and Tor.
 .
 For example it allows using Tor Browser's New Identity feature on Anonymity
 Distribution Workstations, fixes Tor Browser's about:tor default homepage and
 Tor Button status indicator without exposing commands that are dangerous for
 anonymity.
 .
 This package is supposed to be installed on Anonymity Distributions.
 .
 It seamlessly integrates if the anon-ws-disable-stacked-tor package
 is installed on a Anonymity Distribution Workstations. For example it then
 allows running a unmodified Tor Browser Bundle from The Tor Project without
 Tor over Tor and with functional New Identity and about:tor.
 .
 This control port filter is written in Python. The original Python code
 was forked from the Tails version of control port filter.
 .
 This package is produced independently of, and carries no guarantee from,
 The Tor Project.

Description: Asks for confirmation before opening links
 Asks before a link is (accidentally) opened in a browser. Links are opened in
 x-www-browser.
 .
 Currently only the Tor Browser starter from the tb-starter package (by Whonix
 developers) supports using open-link-confirmation. Shell wrappers could be
 written to support other browsers as well.
 .
 On an Anonymity Gateway (when the anon-gw-base-files package is installed), it
 honors the $EDITOR environment variable (falls back to kwrite if unset), asks
 if a file should be opened in an editor before opening it and informs, that
 opening links on a Gateway is unsupported for security reasons.
 .
 This package is produced independently of, and carries no guarantee from,
 The Tor Project.

Description: RAM Adjusted Desktop Starter
 If there is more than X MB RAM in total, the desktop environment will be
 started.
 .
 If less than X MB RAM in total (for example, only 196 MB RAM in total), no
 desktop environment will be started.
 .
 This should be quite convenient, because users with low RAM could reduce Y MB
 and even if they sometimes wanted to configure/check something, they could
 assign 512 RAM and automagically boot into the graphical desktop. There are
 also many settings in /etc/rads.d/ (stackable) to configure this feature, so
 if you want, you can also add a lot RAM, but not boot into a desktop
 environment, or use different display managers and so on.
 .
 Most useful in virtual machines.

Description: application launcher to start apps in a restrictive sandbox
 sandbox-app-launcher runs each app as its own user, in a bubblewrap sandbox
 and confined by apparmor.
 .
 The directory, `/shared`, is shared across all app sandboxes to transfer
 files across.
 .
 This implements a permissions system to configure what apps can access.
 There are currently 5 available permissions:
 .
  * Network access
 .
  * Webcam access
 .
  * Microphone access
 .
  * Shared storage access (read-only or read-write)
 .
  * Dynamic native code execution
 .
 All apps the user installs will be automatically configured to run in
 the sandbox and a prompt will ask the user which permissions they wish to
 grant the application (not implemented yet).
 .
 Currently a WIP and not for actual use.

Description: Secure Distributed Network Time Synchronization
 Time keeping is crucial for security, privacy, and anonymity. Sdwdate is a Tor
 friendly replacement for rdate and ntpdate that sets the system's clock by
 communicating via onion encrypted TCP with Tor onion webservers.
 .
 At randomized intervals, sdwdate connects to a variety of webservers and
 extracts the time stamps from http headers (RFC 2616).
 Using sclockadj option, time is gradually adjusted preventing bigger clock
 jumps that could confuse logs, servers, Tor, i2p, etc.
 .
 This package contains the sdwdate time fetcher and daemon. No
 installation on remote servers required. To avoid conflicts, this daemon
 should not be enabled together with ntp or tlsdated.

Description: Tor Browser Downloader by Whonix developers
 Automates download and verification of Tor Browser from The Tor Project's
 website. Useful for initial installation of Tor Browser, clean
 re-installations of Tor Browser and keeping newly created Qubes AppVMs
 inherited from updated Qubes TemplateVMs can ship up to date versions of
 Tor Browsers.
 .
 Incapable of preserving of updating and preserving user data. Use
 Tor Browser's internal updater for that purpose. Notifies about already
 exiting installations of Tor Browser. Renamed rather than deletes old versions
 of Tor Browsers to avoid user data loss.
 .
 Has a cli and a gui mode. Can auto detect latest version numbers or use user
 configured version numbers. Comes with a download confirmation screen that
 lets users choose which version to download. [1] Has a installation
 confirmation screen [2] that enables users to detect indefinite freeze and
 rollback attacks.
 .
 Integrates well with tb-starter, tb-default-browser and
 open-link-confirmation package as well as with Qubes.
 .
 Without the helper-scripts package installed, the GUI will not move the
 progress bar.
 .
 If you have the helper-scripts package installed, it will show a nicer
 progress bar when run in terminal and more meaningful curl exit code
 messages, when curl failed.
 .
 When having the helper-scripts package installed (recommended for
 Anonymity Distributions), Tor Browser Downloader will check, that Tor is
 enabled, that no package manager is currently running and that Tor finished
 bootstrapping before download attempts.
 .
 Supports being run inside chroot and from Debian maintainer postinst script.
 .
 Qubes integration:
 .
  - Up-to-date browser versions made available to freshly created AppVMs and
 DispVMs.
  - In DispVM mounts browser folder which resides in root image to user home
 folder rather than copying for faster browser startup.

Description: TCP ISN CPU Information Leak Protection
 TCP Initial Sequence Numbers Randomization to prevent TCP ISN based CPU
 Information Leaks.
 .
 The Linux kernel has a side-channel information leak bug.
 It is leaked in any outgoing traffic.
 This can allow side-channel attacks because sensitive information about
 a system's CPU activity is leaked.
 .
 It may prove very dangerous for long-running cryptographic operations. [A]
 .
 Research has demonstrated that it can be used for de-anonymization of
 location-hidden services. [1]
 .
 Clock skew,
 .
  - is leaked through TCP ISNs (Initial Sequence Number) by the Linux kernel.
  - can be remotely detected through observing ISNs.
  - can be induced by an attacker through producing load on the victim machine.
 .
 Quote Security researcher Steven J. Murdoch
 (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK) [B]
 .
 "What the Linux ISN leaks is the difference between two timestamps, not the
 timestamp itself. A difference lets you work out drift and skew, which can
 help someone fingerprint the computer hardware, its environment and load. Of
 course that only works if you can probe a computer, and maintain the same
 source/destination port and IP address."
 .
 Quote Mike Perry, developer at The Tor Project [A]:
 .
 "... it is worth complaining to the kernel developers for the simple
 reason that adding the 64ns timer post-hash probably *does* leak side channels
 about CPU activity, and that may prove very dangerous for long-running
 cryptographic operations (along the lines of the hot-or-not issue).
 Unfortunately, someone probably needs to produce more research papers before
 they will listen."
 .
 tirdad is a kernel module to hot-patch the Linux kernel
 to generate random TCP Initial Sequence Numbers for IPv4 TCP connections.
 .

Description: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.
 .
 Clients choose a source-routed path through a set of relays, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each relay
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing
 down the circuit is decrypted at each relay, which reveals the
 downstream relay.
 .
 Basically, Tor provides a distributed network of relays. Users bounce
 their TCP streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc) around the relays, and
 recipients, observers, and even the relays themselves have difficulty
 learning which users connected to which destinations.
 .
 This package enables only a Tor client by default, but it can also be
 configured as a relay and/or a hidden service easily.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 socks proxy interface provided by your Tor instance. If the application
 itself does not come with socks support, you can use a socks client
 such as torsocks.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning on application traffic. There
 is a danger that application protocols and associated programs can be
 induced to reveal information about the user. Tor depends on Torbutton
 and similar protocol cleaners to solve this problem. For best
 protection when web surfing, the Tor Project recommends that you use
 the Tor Browser Bundle, a standalone tarball that includes static
 builds of Tor, Torbutton, and a modified Firefox that is patched to fix
 a variety of privacy bugs.

Description: GeoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a GeoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridge relays (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor
 directory) use this information to report which countries they see
 connections from.  These statistics enable the Tor network operators to
 learn when certain countries start blocking access to bridges.
 .
 Clients can also use this to learn what country each relay is in, so
 Tor controllers like arm or Vidalia can use it, or if they want to
 configure path selection preferences.

 To circumvent a uwt wrapper on a by case base, you append ".anondist-real" to
 the command, for example "apt-get.anondist-real". You can also deactivate
 specific or all uwt wrappers by using the stackable .d-style configuration
 folder /etc/uwt.d.
 .
 Uwt can only work only as good as torsocks. If torsocks is unable to route all
 of an application's traffic over Tor, ex. if there is an leak, there will
 also be one when using uwt. For that reason, it is recommended to use
 Anonymity Distributions, that prevent such leaks.
 .
 If an applications has native support for socks proxy settings, those should
 be preferred over uwt. Also refer to the TorifyHOWTO and your distribution's
 documentation.
 .
 Timeprivacy can keep your time private. You can create wrappers for
 applications and timeprivacy will feed those applications with a fake time,
 which obfuscates at which time you really used that applications (such as when
 you made the git commit or when you signed that document). It does NOT set
 your time zone to UTC.
 .
 This package is probably most useful for Anonymity Distributions.
 .
 This package is produced independently of, and carries no guarantee from,
 The Tor Project.

Description: usability enhancements inside virtual machines
 Enables auto login for user `user` in `lightdm`.
 `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/30_autologin.conf`
 https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Desktop#Disable_Autologin
 .
 Sets environment variable `QMLSCENE_DEVICE=softwarecontext` as workaround for
 "Automatic fallback to softwarecontext renderer".
 .
 It is not useful to open a screensaver or to power down the desktop for
 operating systems that are run inside VMs. There is no real display that could
 be saved and no real power that could be saved. From usability perspective it
 also is counter intuitive when looking at the VM window and only seeing a
 black screen. Therefore it makes sense to disable power savings in VMs.

 .
 Disables screen locker when running in VMs because that is not useful either.
 .
 Makes setting up a shared folder for virtual machines a bit easier.
 .
  * Creates a folder `/mnt/shared` with `chmod 777`, adds a group
 "vboxsf", adds user "user" to group "vboxsf". Facilitates auto-mounting of
 shared folders.
 .
  * Helps using shared folders with VirtualBox and KVM a bit
 easier (as in requiring fewer manual steps from the user).
 .
  * `/lib/systemd/system/mnt-shared-vbox.service`
  * `/lib/systemd/system/mnt-shared-kvm.service`
 .
 Set screen resolution 1920x1080 by default for VM in VirtualBox and KVM.
 Workaround for low screen resolution 1024x768 at first boot. When using lower
 screen resolutions, Xfce will automatically scale down.
 `/etc/skel/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/displays.xml`
 .
 Installs VirtualBox guest additions if package
 `virtualbox-guest-additions-iso` is installed if environment variable
 `dist_build_virtualbox=true` or if running inside VirtualBox.
